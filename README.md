# Ocaml-gen

This Rust library allows you to automatically generate OCaml bindings for your Rust code. It is meant to be used in conjunction with [`ocaml-rs`](https://github.com/zshipko/ocaml-rs).

**SECURITY WARNING: this is still an experimental library, you should verify that the bindings generated are correct if you are using this in production**.

See the [ocaml-gen/ README](/ocaml-gen) for more information.
